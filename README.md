# GestureRecognitionThesis

this includes all the classfiers and feature extraction programs developped as a part of my thesis

First, you will need to download all zip files from the DB3 + subject 1 from the DB2

You will then run the feature extraction program

Then you can run any traditional machine learning algorithm, and it should produce all confusion matrices for each sunject per model

For Neural Networks, you will need to run the segemntation code before.
